			<h3> Broken Circuits </h3> 
			<img src="brokencircuit1.JPG" />
			<p> This circuit does not work because the ground wire is connected to a rail where there are no other pieces of the circuit. The current cannot flow through all parts of the circuit. </p>
			<img src="brokencircuit2.JPG" />
			<p> This circuit does not work becuase the resistor is not connecting the ground wire to the rest of the circuit like it should be. The circuit would work if the end of the resistor was on the same rail as the ground wire. </p>
			<h2> Challenge 1 </h2>

			<a href="challenge1.txt"> Code </a>
			<p> In order to make the LED blink, I added time.sleep to the time when the LED was off. I then coppied this coded and repeated it multiple times and changed the time.sleep for each, so the light would blink at different intervals. </p>
